# ViperX_TikTok - Bot
Tiktok Viewbot, Likebot, Followbot and Comment Liker Currenly viewbotting is only working i will add more features later. TikTok View bot
TikTok-Automated-Viewbot
Repeatedly sends TikTok Views to a video of choice.

# Information
This tool was developed to demonstrate how straightforward it is to automate a service like zefoy.com. They have their own TikTok Viewbot you can use, but can only send 1000 views each 5 minutes — it was recently changed from 60 to 330 seconds. My script automates that process, helping you go AFK (away from keyboard). Simply paste a TikTok video URL, come back in an hour and the TikTok video should have 12.000 more views! You will receive 288.000 views a day.


Usage of this tool will definitely cause the targeted video to be on the TikTok "For You" page — increases chances to become TikTok famous. Please refrain from using this TikTok Automated Viewbot as viewbotting is against TikTok's Terms of Service. Nevertheless, if you use this, you are doing it at your own risk. You have been warned.

# Usage
Python 3.6 or above is required.
Selenium, Colorama is also required.

Check your Google Chrome version. If you have V.88, you can keep the included chromedriver.exe. If you have any other Google Chrome version, download chromedriver.exe with the matching version here to main.py's file directory.

# Legal Notice
Viewbotting is generally prohibited, and should under no circumstances be done. vipto.de is not recommended to use as TikTok is strictly against viewbotting. TikTok Automated Viewbot automates that "illegal" process, so please refrain from using it — developed for educational purposes only.

Thanks to zoony that i could copy paste and change this description as the softwares are basically the same but the code is different. This viewbot works as autoclicker on the zefoy.com site
